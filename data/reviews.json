        "body": "<p>and he did not take pleasure, as some men did, in believing himself betrayed </p> <p>PUNO, PERU -- this should be a review of &quot;the count of monte cristo.&quot; it's not. i read the first two pages of that very, very long book, had a subsequently quite satisfying &quot;nope!&quot; moment, and grabbed this book instead, which is almost as heavy, and which i usually made my girlfriend lug because it didn't fit in my carry-on. she threatened to throw it off (very scenic-looking) mountains multiple times. if it had been that damn dumas, i dont think i would have been able to say no.</p> <p>the disappointing thing about historical fiction (i.e, books that were written a rlly long time ago, as opposed to those merely set in the past) is that they seem to lack the consciousness we expect and feel in our everyday lives. &quot;the count of monte cristo,&quot; as far as i can tell, is mostly ppl crying &quot;hark.&quot; tho of course there are obvious exceptions (shakespeare), rarely do we encounter the knight errant stopping mid-charge to wonder &quot;isn't this a tad cliche?&quot; Which of course is why we (i) love historical fiction. because it transposes our modern awareness into the foreign past, where this consciousness rarely feels self-crippling, probably because the ups and downs of the past seem less treacherous, because we know that it all works out OK in the end. (corollary: i would happily serve in any past war as long as I knew i wouldnt be hurt in any way, or suffer from any of the more exotic forms of trench diarrhea. who wouldn't?) and of course the past is always more exciting, because it was harder, and therefore more authentic(???). </p> <p>CONTENT THOUGHTS</p> <p>- so &quot;the luminaries&quot; is a great book of strikingly modern psychological insight disguised as astrological interpretation. from what i can tell, there really is a zodiacal scheme guiding the plot and the power relations between characters, but catton's diagnosis of psychology has nothing to do with the stars, and everything to do with our contemporary understanding of personality and persona.</p> <p>- Like horoscopes, conversely, these insights seem both deeply personal and yet totally universal. this is not really a bad thing, but you can almost set your clock by the royal-we narrator's analytical intrusions, which always reminded me of those Thinking/Feeling/DJFKNJKJASDF personality tests where none of the results are: you are an ass, even tho we know these ppl exist and walk among us. </p> <p>- plot relies on a number of coincidences, which didnt really bother me, but suffered from the &quot;scooby doo we gotta warp this up in 3 minutes&quot; problem, where several of the main 'mysteries' that drove the plot were essentially summarized. some problems were actually left for the reader to infer, which i should like, but since other plot points were recounted by exactly 12 different characters, and then later reiterated by the narrator, the later need for reader inferences seemed like laziness. </p> <p>- another annoying thing: (c'mon bruh u rlly afraid of da spoil) (view spoiler)</p> <p>- i read this book on (variously) plane, bus, bed, minivan and riverside rock, all of which were located in various countries that are not America, and therefore i could not engage in my usual practice of using my iphone to google words i am not familiar with, then getting distracted on the twitter app, then throwing the book out the window because, fuck books. the upside of this was i actually managed to finish this novel. the downside was, 834 pages later, i still don't know what a &quot;barque&quot; is, which turned out to be everyone's favorite word. i also dont know the definition of accoucheuse. or andirons. sighhhhh </p> <p>- this book has been to macchu pichu; have u ?</p> <p>the benefit of the doubt, to take the common phrase, was a haphazard gift</p>"

        "body": "<p>she was too weak to be harmless </p> <p>there are absurd comic universes, and there are spooky scary absurd universes, but i'm not sure the two mix well. </p> <p>we understand that fright, connotatively, is paralyzing&mdash;think scared stiff. it's why we can't look away. and it's more than slightly ironic that most uncritically-thinking critics (me) call out horror media for being 'unrealistic.' because unreality is precisely what these fictions offer; they are scary because the rules of reality have changed, making it ir. </p> <p>that's why it doesn't matter if the babysitter chooses to hide in the closet or the basement or the attic or any other enclosed, exitless space that screams &quot;murder me here,&quot; instead of just calling the cops or running outside. because it wouldn't matter. because there is no &quot;outside&quot; in horror. it's the entire foundation of reality that's shifted an inch to the left, exposing a hole. </p> <p>that's why it doesn't bother me when A doesn't comment on the grim confection commercials that seem impossibly too anticapital to ever be aired on TV. Not only does her paralysis make sense in the face of the uncanny, more importantly, you can't call reality unrealistic. and for her, and for us, it is real. </p> <p>but, unfortunately, this book is about 30 % too funny. humor offers us another window into the absurd, but we expect the main character to be in on the joke. they understand that nothing makes sense, and thus act accordingly to their own gain. and this Yossarian/Heller-esque knowledge is the exact converse of the paranoia (which is really a fear of suspected knowledge) and creeping, totalizing sense of not-rightness that produces effective postmodern dread. </p> <p>the end result was never displeasing; the funny bits were funny and the terror-filled parts were terrific. but the overall mood of the piece suffered (see tonally disruptive concepts like disappearing dad disorder, which felt like a joke pulled from weird twitter). and thematically, I was less sure what kleeman was trying to say. from a completely cynical perspective, a 'funny' book seems less important &quot;to literature,&quot; whatever that is, which makes it harder to trick nebbish book readers into deifying you (the only goal of EVERY WRITER--IM LOOKING AT U, ME)</p> <p>but perhaps im just a complete asshole </p> <p>CONTENT THOUGHTS </p> <p>- kleeman hasnt gotten a lot of credit as a prose stylist, though she certainly is one, as evinced thru passages like: &quot;freezers full of frosted flesh cast a low blue light,&quot; where u can almost feel the consonant fricatives gliding into the ululating assonant glottal noise of 'low,' 'blue' and 'light' (did i mention i used 2 b an english major). another example: &quot;most substances machinate more subtly.&quot; </p> <p>she also just uses language and syntax inventively, finding the darker way to describe the ordinary actions and movements that make up the bulk of the novel. see: &quot;the tires turning against the road, rubbing themselves out on it&quot; </p> <p>- at the same time, she is also the sort of writer who, as a rule, would rather use an unfamiliar adjectival form over a familiar one. so: &quot;It was palindromic,&quot; over the probably preferably &quot;it was a palindrome.&quot; see: 'vulvar.' </p> <p>- while probably the best novel starring a copy editor ive ever read, it's also the only novel starring a copy editor i've ever read. which, conversely, makes it the worst novel starring [ditto] i've ever read as well. </p> <p>- the jacket flap copy writer is pretty sure you'll want to compare kleeman with pynchon, delillo and fucking paul auster (which, for review purposes, it would be helpful if i had ever actually read any of them), but i think kleeman has a lot to offer that i really doubt any of the aforementioned white men could bring to the genre. &quot;body&quot; is a novel novel that is concerned with consumption both figurative and literal, and i would recommend it to anyone interested in body politics or writing on anorexia in general. </p> <p>- and if you're not interested in digging that deeply, you can still read it (esp. the scenes between A and B) as a horror movie set inside a barbie doll house. </p> <p>- that fact that im mentioning this only just now says a lot about my own biases than anything, but kleeman struggles with plot, including a twist regarding B and C's relationship that will surprise absolutely no one cognizant of standard plot conventions. The ending too, felt like something out of student writing, where the author realizes she needs to make her character dynamic, have an epiphany, and regain the will to live all in 500 words or fewer. </p> <p>- its not at all surprising that kleeman is a phd candidate, who is interested in things like literary analysis. but sometimes great thesis material doesn't make for the most engrossing pacing...</p> <p>- overall feedback: could have used more riveting copy editing scenes. ('watch out! there's an error of substitution right behind u!) </p> <p>he had seemed like a different person, or the same person acting differently, an even scarier thought</p>"

        "body": "<p>&ldquo;the secret place&rdquo; is a book about a gaggle of girls who find it so unbelievable that a tween boy might not be a total, unremitting poonhound that they kill him for it. </p> <p>in their defense, the boy is later revealed to be a semi poonhound. </p> <p>tonally, it&rsquo;s not &lsquo;night of the undead feminists&rsquo; (which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily sound like a bad thing), but for the reader, it&rsquo;s a chance to relive and vicariously re-hate all those middle-school-attending, classroom-airtime-monopolizing, unsuccessfully-boner-hiding, and of course, boob-staring boys. </p> <p>as a reformed boy, i am right there with them. the only difference between marriage and middle school is that, at least in marriage, there&rsquo;s only one booger-breather hogging the covers. </p> <p>it&rsquo;s hard to write about this w/o sounding like [gasp! a female writing a novel about murder!? without the written permission of her parent or chaperone?!! someone alert the authorities] but you don&rsquo;t have to read many lines like this (&ldquo;her and this guy: that thud will take them both across one-way borderlines, into worlds they can&rsquo;t imagine&rdquo;), to understand that the crime novel has shifted from its thoroughly masculine origins. </p> <p>(though of course there are obvious exceptions: cough cough wheeze gasp stieg larsson/ benjamin percy/ those clive barker/gun shootman books they only sell at airports and safeways) </p> <p>(though of course there are obvious exceptions to the exceptions: cough cough GONE GIRL / Woman on the train, etc, which are both written by women and have strong female agency)</p> <p>AND, just to be clear, (plz dont hate me): im not trying to recast &ldquo;the secret place&rdquo; as one of those aggressively pink noir serials titled something like &ldquo;ms. crumpet&rsquo;s all ladies private GUY detective/tea time agency.&rdquo; those books have been with us for a long time. </p> <p>it&rsquo;s just that, for a genre that was predicated on manly toughness, where the murdered was likely a woman, and her killer a man, tana french is a good example of&#8230; [something]</p> <p>CONTENT THOUGHTS</p> <p>-spooky scary magical realism element would have been more palatable as a metaphor for the enchanting/dreamlike qualities of young adulthood if tween protagon had not str8-up identified it as such</p> <p>-magical dream urgency of youth metaphor would have been even less annoying if it had been relevant to the plot, instead of sorta bomb-dropped round page 200, then deployed in a lot of &lsquo;descriptive paragraph asides&rsquo; that dont go anywere, so no one can accuse tana french of just writing plot, then phased out completely with 150 pages left to go. </p> <p>-enjoy no-irony, trust-the-police lines like: &rdquo;I can swear to you, hand on heart, there&rsquo;s a lot more guilty people acquitted than innocent ones in jail.&rdquo; </p> <p>-so detective moran is supposed to be this master debat-- interrogator, but his profiling and categorization had all the subtlety of video game dialogue boxes, where one option is &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a nice sweater&rdquo; and the other is &ldquo;fuck u, chief&rdquo; </p> <p>-listening to serial has probably ruined all procedurals for me</p> <p>-cops used screenwriter 101 logic and investigate the teen gang you&rsquo;d never expect, instead of the snotty teenage girl squad cribbing their lines off mean girls. this counterintuitive decision pays off perfectly, when the least-expected-y teen girl of the never-expected girl gang turns out to be the killer. </p> <p>-irish ppl call merry-go-rounds &ldquo;roundabouts&rdquo; &#8230; lol</p> <p>-DID ANYONE LOOK UP THE SONG??? I STILL TOO BUSY NOT LOOKING UP THE SONG FROM STEPHEN CHBOKSKSUSHYS &ldquo;THE PERKS OF BEING A PARIGUAYO&rdquo; &#8230;.</p>"
